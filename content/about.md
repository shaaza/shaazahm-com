### Work

My career has primarily been in software. I started coding when I was 13, and messing around with dubious network security projects. My first 'job' was co-founding an ed-tech startup that sold customized Raspberry Pis to NGOs, while in college. I love learning and helping people learn, and would love to work in education in some capacity in the future.

After college, I built smart meters for a [Swiss energy startup](https://www.climate-kic.org/start-ups/shared-electric/), later joining as a full stack web dev, first engineer on the team. I did some React front-end dev for a bit after that, and finally joined [an employee-owned software cooperative](https://nilenso.com/) building Clojure/Go/Ruby backends. While I was there, I mostly worked as a product engineer for a [scaleup ride-hailing unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojek) in Indonesia, optimizing the pick-up and geolocations experience.

I moved to Dublin in 2019 to do a [High-Performance Computing MSc](https://www.tcd.ie/courses/postgraduate/courses/high-performance-computing-msc--pgraddip/) at Trinity College Dublin **and** followed soon after by an [MSc in Software Engineering at Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-software-engineering). I know, it's mad to do two demanding degrees at the same time. I don't recommend it: I barely had a social life, lost a lot of weight, rarely took time off, and did little else but study. However, I loved learning what I had to learn, and really made the most of it. The Trinity degree was very hands-on, covering computational physics, computational finance and systems programming, while the Oxford degree in true Oxford style took a rigorous and theoretical approach, covering algorithms, distributed systems, formal methods, neural networks. However, the degree helped build a great network of peers working on interesting problems in very different partss of the industry--from directors of automotive self-driving initiatives to safety software in nuclear power plants.

Soon after graduating, I joined Amazon as an software engineer on the AWS Lambda team, one of AWS most successful and 'cutting-edge' products. I did some relatively low-level systems work that was also very close to product and users (developers)--quite the dream combo for a product-minded CS-geek. I spent five years there, contributing as an engineer to the launch of features such as [Response Streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/), [Extensions API](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-extensions-in-preview/) and [Container Images](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/aws-lambda-now-supports-container-images-as-a-packaging-format/) and ongoing work on offerings such as the [Runtime API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-api.html) and the [Execution Environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtime-environment.html).

After five years at AWS, I joined [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.com/) in May 2024 as Head of Engineering. I'm really enjoying the work, the culture and the domain. The founders espouse values that are refreshingly different from some of the grey, uninspiring, American big corp culture that my team at Amazon had somehow landed in. The users are passionate about the product, and the engineers bring their whole selves to work and keep the work environment fun and friendly. The developer experience product space is one that we find easy to relate to as engineers, and it's great to work in a leadership role that combines engineering, product and management, even at this scale. I'll refrain from commenting further about this experience, as it is still very much in progress and changing.
