### Life

Work in progress.


### Work

I've mostly built software products. I started coding and messing around with network security when I was thirteen. In college, I co-founded an ed-tech startup that sold customized Raspberry Pis to NGOs: education is a problem that holds my heart.

After college, I prototyped hardware for a [Swiss energy startup](https://www.climate-kic.org/start-ups/shared-electric/) for an internship and then joined as the first full stack web dev. After that, I joined [an employee-owned software cooperative](https://nilenso.com/) building Clojure/Go/Ruby backends, and learnt a lot. While I was there, I mostly worked as a product engineer for a [scaleup ride-hailing unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gojek) in Indonesia.

After my master's degree, I joined Amazon as an software engineer on the [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/) team in Dublin. That involved a mix of relatively low-level systems software, developer experience and  product engineering, quite the dream combo. I contributed to features such as [Response Streaming](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-response-streaming/) and the [Extensions API](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-extensions-in-preview/).

After five years at AWS, I joined [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.com/) in May 2024 as Head of Engineering. I'm enjoying the work, the people, the culture and the domain. We have users who love the product, and my peers bring their whole selves to work and keep the work environment fun, friendly and authentic.

### Education 

I did my schooling in Dubai. I moved to St. Xavier's College, Mumbai for high school, which was the best educational and cultural environment I've been in till date. It holds a special place in my heart. 

I really got into Theoretical Physics around then and followed that curiosity to an [alternate school in Bangalore](https://cfrce.com/). I completed my undergrad degree in Physics, Math and Electronics at Christ University and met some of my favourite people there.

I moved to Dublin later for [MSc in High-Performance Computing](https://www.tcd.ie/courses/postgraduate/courses/high-performance-computing-msc--pgraddip/) at Trinity College Dublin, covering computational physics, computational finance and systems programming. I spent all my evenings in the library and read a ton of books during this period, including many programming classics, and absolutely loved it.

I also completed an [MSc in Software Engineering at Oxford University](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-software-engineering). The modules were aligned with a formal Computer Science degree and the approach rigorous. I studied algorithms, distributed systems, formal methods, neural networks. I met some great people from very different parts of the industry. All the annoying elitism aside, this was a life-changing experience and I made some great friends.
