# Me in 20 seconds

Physics grad turned software engineer turned product engineer. 

I play cricket, write poetry and build software. I consume a lot of fiction, poetry, cinema and music (and food). I love the outdoors and being in nature: forests, beaches, lakes. I'm either in London for work, in rural Ireland for some slow living, or visiting family in Kerala.


# What am I doing now?

### What am I working on? 
I'm currently building [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/), a developer-friendly cloud infra platform at a YC-backed startup, with some great people. Adam Wiggins of Heroku [writes about some of the problems we're tackling](https://adamwiggins.com/making-computers-better/create) much better than I could.

### What quest am I on?
I tend to have an [overarching quest](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/you-are-going-on-a-quest/) that changes every now and then. Right now, that quest is learning to change my relationship with work, by harmonizing being and doing, heart and head, work and life. Some things that have transformed my life include a [daily meditation practice](https://www.wakingup.com/), ['heartful' leadership coaching](https://arnaudsaintpaul.com/), a supportive work environment and books by authors such as [Iain McGilchrist](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Master-His-Emissary-Divided-Western/dp/0300188374), [Oliver Pourriol](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51007722-the-french-art-of-not-trying-too-hard) and [Alan Watts](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Book-Taboo-Against-Knowing-Who/dp/028563853X).

### What am I learning?

I'm learning to write poetry [with Josh Hallam once a week](https://ko-fi.com/wordspace), training to bowl faster [with Ross Dewar's cricket training programme](https://cricketstrength.com/), learning Arabic [through Trinity College Dublin's evening classes](https://www.tcd.ie/nmes/courses/evening-course/arabic/#:~:text=Course%20Fee,will%20be%20organised%20for%20you), and picking up Rust at work.
