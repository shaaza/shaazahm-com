# Me in 20 seconds

Physics grad turned software engineer turned startup leader. 

I play cricket, write poetry, and build software. I consume a lot of fiction, poetry, cinema and music (and food!). I love the outdoors and being in nature: forests, beaches, lakes

I'm an Indian-origin, Dubai-raised, Dublin-brewed third-culture kid. I'm either in London for work, in rural Ireland for some slow living, or visiting family in Kerala.


# What am I doing now?

I'm currently Head of Engineering at Shuttle, a YC-backed startup building a developer-friendly cloud infra platform to build backends quickly in Rust. 

Since May 2024, I'm trying to change the way I work by harmonizing being and doing, heart and head, work and life. Some things that have helped tremendously include a daily [meditation practice](https://www.wakingup.com/), weekly [leadership coaching](https://arnaudsaintpaul.com/), a supportive work environment and some life-changing books.

I'm also learning to write poetry [with Josh Hallam once a week](https://ko-fi.com/wordspace), training to bowl faster [with Ross Dewar's cricket training programme](https://cricketstrength.com/) and learning Arabic [through Trinity College Dublin's evening classes](https://www.tcd.ie/nmes/courses/evening-course/arabic/#:~:text=Course%20Fee,will%20be%20organised%20for%20you).

# What am I reading right now?

Kerri Maher's [The Paris Bookseller](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paris-Bookseller-Kerri-Maher-ebook/dp/B097GF2B38), and skimming through ten other books.
